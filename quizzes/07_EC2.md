Below are 100+ interview questions on AWS EC2, organized by topic, with detailed answers to test a deep understanding of EC2.

---

## 1. EC2 Fundamentals

1. **What is Amazon EC2 and what core problems does it solve?**
   **Answer:** Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It solves problems of hardware procurement lead times, fixed capacity, and complex datacenter management, allowing users to scale compute resources up or down as needed.

2. **Explain the EC2 shared responsibility model.**
   **Answer:** AWS is responsible for security *of* the cloud (physical infrastructure, hypervisor, etc.). Customers are responsible for security *in* the cloud: OS hardening, patching, firewall configuration, IAM, data encryption, and application security.

3. **What are key EC2 resource constructs (Instances, AMIs, EBS, Security Groups)?**
   **Answer:** Instances are virtual servers; AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) are templates; EBS (Elastic Block Store) volumes provide persistent block storage; Security Groups act as virtual firewalls controlling inbound/outbound traffic.

4. **Describe the different EC2 purchasing options.**
   **Answer:** On-Demand (pay per hour/second), Reserved Instances (1- or 3-year commitment for discounts), Savings Plans (compute or EC2 instance type), Spot Instances (bid for unused capacity), Dedicated Hosts (physical server dedicated to you), Dedicated Instances.

5. **How do you choose between On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot?**
   **Answer:** On-Demand for unpredictable workloads; Reserved Instances/Savings Plans for steady-state predictable usage; Spot for fault-tolerant, flexible tasks.

## 2. Instance Types & Sizing

6. **What EC2 instance families exist and their use cases?**
   **Answer:** General Purpose (T, M): balanced CPU/memory; Compute Optimized (C): CPU-bound; Memory Optimized (R, X, Z): memory-bound; Storage Optimized (I, D, H): high I/O; Accelerated Computing (P, G, F): GPU/FPGA/ML.

7. **Explain burstable performance instances (T-family) and CPU credits.**
   **Answer:** T instances accumulate CPU credits when idle and spend them for bursts. Baseline performance % defines accrual rate; credits expire after 24 hours.

8. **What is an EC2 instance type virtualization difference: HVM vs. PV?**
   **Answer:** HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) uses hardware virtualization with better performance (EBS optimization, ENA network). PV (Paravirtual) uses Xen para-virtualization, older, limited features.

9. **How do you right-size an EC2 instance?**
   **Answer:** Monitor CPU, memory, network, and disk metrics with CloudWatch; use AWS Compute Optimizer; analyze utilization and adjust instance family or size.

10. **What is Nitro?**
    **Answer:** Nitro is AWS's lightweight hypervisor architecture that offloads virtualization to dedicated hardware, improving performance, security, and reduced overhead.

## 3. Storage & Persistence

11. **Explain EBS volume types and use cases.**
    **Answer:** gp2/gp3 (General Purpose SSD), io1/io2 (Provisioned IOPS SSD), st1 (Throughput Optimized HDD), sc1 (Cold HDD), and magnetic. Choose by IOPS, throughput, and cost requirements.

12. **What is EBS optimization and how does it work?**
    **Answer:** EBS-optimized instances provide dedicated network bandwidth for EBS I/O. The Nitro network stack handles traffic isolation for higher and consistent throughput.

13. **How do you snapshot an EBS volume, and how are incremental snapshots stored?**
    **Answer:** Use `CreateSnapshot`. Snapshots are incremental: only blocks changed since last snapshot are stored, reducing storage usage.

14. **Describe Elastic File System (EFS) vs. EBS.**
    **Answer:** EFS is a fully managed NFS file system for multiple simultaneously connected instances. EBS is block-level storage, attached to a single instance (per volume) at a time.

15. **How do you detach and attach an EBS volume safely to another instance?**
    **Answer:** Unmount filesystem, stop I/O, use AWS CLI/Console to detach, then attach to new instance, and mount with correct device mapping.

## 4. Networking

16. **What is the default VPC and what network constructs does EC2 require?**
    **Answer:** Each region has a default VPC with a default subnet per AZ. To launch EC2 in custom VPC, requires subnets, route tables, Internet Gateway (for public), and security groups.

17. **Explain Public vs. Private IP, Elastic IP, and how they work.**
    **Answer:** Private IP is only within VPC. Public IP is dynamic and changes on stop/start. Elastic IP is static public IPv4 that you allocate and associate with an instance for consistent addressing.

18. **What is ENA, and why should it be used?**
    **Answer:** Elastic Network Adapter provides high throughput (up to 100Gbps) and low latency networking for EC2 Nitro instances.

19. **How do Security Groups differ from Network ACLs?**
    **Answer:** Security Groups are stateful firewalls at instance level, only allow explicit rules. NACLs are stateless at subnet level and have both allow and deny rules, applied in order.

20. **Describe how to set up an instance in a private subnet with Internet access.**
    **Answer:** Launch in private subnet, configure default route to NAT Gateway in public subnet. Public subnet must have Internet Gateway attached.

---

## 5. Security & IAM

21. **How do you secure SSH access to EC2 instances?**
    **Answer:** Use key pairs, disable password logins, restrict Security Group inbound on port 22 to specific IPs, use Session Manager (SSM) for bastion-less access.

22. **What is IAM role for EC2, and how is it different from IAM user credentials on instance?**
    **Answer:** IAM role attached to instance via instance profile grants temporary credentials via metadata service. Avoids embedding static credentials.

23. **What is the EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) and versions?**
    **Answer:** IMDS provides instance-specific info and credentials. v1 allows simple requests; v2 requires session tokens (more secure). You can enforce IMDSv2 only.

24. **How do you enforce IMDSv2 on instances?**
    **Answer:** Set Metadata options: `HttpTokens: required` when launching or via `ModifyInstanceMetadataOptions` to require v2.

25. **How do you encrypt root and data volumes?**
    **Answer:** Use AWS-managed or customer-managed KMS keys, specify encryption at volume creation. For root, create custom encrypted AMI or use encryption by default EBS settings.

## 6. Scaling & Load Balancing

26. **Explain vertical vs. horizontal scaling in EC2.**
    **Answer:** Vertical scaling (scale-up) changes instance size. Horizontal scaling (scale-out) adds/removes instances via Auto Scaling Groups.

27. **What is an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and how does it work?**
    **Answer:** ASG defines a group of instances, minimum/max/desired, and scaling policies based on metrics or schedules to maintain capacity.

28. **Describe EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks.**
    **Answer:** Lifecycle hooks allow custom actions (e.g., configuration, validation) during instance launch or termination before reaching InService or Terminated state.

29. **How do you integrate EC2 with Application Load Balancer (ALB) for blue/green deployments?**
    **Answer:** Create two target groups (blue/green), deploy new ASG to green, then modify ALB listener rule to shift traffic gradually from blue to green.

30. **Explain Elastic Load Balancer health checks.**
    **Answer:** Configurable ping path, interval, timeout, and thresholds. Checks instance health to route traffic only to healthy nodes.

---

## 7. High Availability & Architecture Patterns

31. **How do you design EC2 for high availability across AZs?**
    **Answer:** Place ASG instances across multiple AZs, use ELB, replicate data in multiple AZs (e.g., multi-AZ RDS), use EFS or S3 for shared data.

32. **What is placement group and its types?**
    **Answer:** Placement groups influence instance placement: Cluster (low-latency, high network), Spread (isolate for fault tolerance), Partition (for HDFS-like workloads).

33. **When should you use a Dedicated Host vs. Dedicated Instance?**
    **Answer:** Dedicated Host gives visibility into sockets/cores for licensing. Dedicated Instance ensures instances run on hardware isolated at host level.

34. **Explain cross-region replication for AMIs and snapshots.**
    **Answer:** Copy AMI or snapshot to another region manually or via AMI copy. Snapshots can be replicated cross-region or cross-account.

35. **How do you architect stateless vs. stateful EC2 applications for HA?**
    **Answer:** Stateless: store state in external stores (DynamoDB, S3). Stateful: use EBS volumes, sticky sessions, replicate state at application layer.
