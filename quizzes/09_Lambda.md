**AWS Lambda In-Depth Interview Question Bank**

This document contains **100 detailed AWS Lambda questions and answers**, designed to test a deep understanding of AWS Lambda—from basic concepts to advanced use cases and troubleshooting.

---

## 1. Core Concepts

**Q1: What is AWS Lambda and how does its pricing model work?**
**A1:** AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources. You are billed based on the number of requests (first 1M free/month, then \$0.20 per million requests) and the compute time, measured in gigabyte-seconds (GB-s) rounded up to the nearest millisecond. The total cost calculation: `Requests × price per request + Duration (GB‑s) × price per GB‑s.`

**Q2: Explain the Lambda execution environment and how it is managed.**
**A2:** The Lambda execution environment is a microVM (Firecracker) initialized from a runtime-specific container image. AWS provisions and scales these environments on-demand. When a function is invoked, Lambda reuses a warm environment if available; otherwise, it initializes a new one (cold start). The environment includes OS, language runtime, and injected function code & dependencies in `/var/task`.

**Q3: What are cold starts and warm starts? How can you reduce cold start latency?**
**A3:** A cold start occurs when Lambda initializes a new environment for a function (including loading and initializing runtime & code), adding latency. Warm starts reuse an existing environment for subsequent invocations, reducing latency. To mitigate cold starts: provisioned concurrency, smaller deployment packages, runtime choice (e.g., Go, Node.js), keep-alive pings, and minimizing initialization code.

**Q4: List the supported Lambda runtimes. How can you use a custom runtime?**
**A4:** AWS-managed runtimes include Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Ruby, .NET, and custom ARM64 x86\_64. Custom runtimes use the Lambda Runtime API: you package an executable bootstrap file in a Lambda layer or deployment package, which interacts with Lambda’s control plane via HTTP to receive invocation events and return responses.

**Q5: Describe how environment variables are handled in Lambda.**
**A5:** Environment variables are defined per function or version/alias. Values are decrypted at runtime if encrypted with KMS. The AWS Lambda console, CLI, or SDK allows setting env vars. Variables are injected into the process environment; you can reference them in code and also use encrypted secrets via Secrets Manager or Parameter Store.

---

## 2. Configuration and Deployment

**Q6: How do you package and deploy Lambda functions?**
**A6:** You can deploy via the AWS Console ZIP upload, AWS CLI (`aws lambda update-function-code`), AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model), Serverless Framework, CloudFormation, CDK, or Terraform. Packaging includes function code, dependencies, and optionally layers. For compiled languages, include JARs or executables.

**Q7: What are Lambda Layers and when should you use them?**
**A7:** Lambda Layers are ZIP archives of libraries, custom runtimes, or shared code. They let you separate common dependencies and share across multiple functions, reducing package size and improving build times. Up to 5 layers per function; layers versioned separately.

**Q8: Explain the role of execution role and IAM permissions for Lambda.**
**A8:** Each Lambda function assumes an execution role (IAM role) that grants permissions to AWS services and resources it interacts with (e.g., S3, DynamoDB). The role also needs `lambda:InvokeFunction` if invoked by other functions or services. Least privilege principle applies.

**Q9: How can you version your Lambda functions and use aliases?**
**A9:** Lambda versions are immutable snapshots of code and configuration. You publish a new version after testing. Aliases are pointers to versions (e.g., `dev`, `prod`). You can shift traffic gradually between versions (traffic shifting) and integrate with deployment strategies like canary or linear via aliases.

**Q10: Describe how AWS SAM improves Lambda deployment.**
**A10:** AWS SAM extends CloudFormation with simplified syntax (`AWS::Serverless::Function`, events, APIs). It provides CLI (`sam build`, `sam deploy`) for local testing (`sam local invoke`), dependency management, and supports advanced features like nested stacks and transforms.

---

## 3. Event Sources & Integrations

**Q11: Which AWS services can trigger Lambda functions?**
**A11:** S3 (object events), DynamoDB Streams, Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose, SNS, SQS, API Gateway, Application Load Balancer, EventBridge (CloudWatch Events), CloudWatch Logs, CodeCommit, CodePipeline, IoT Core, Step Functions, Cognito, and custom via SDK.

**Q12: Explain synchronous vs asynchronous invocation.**
**A12:** Synchronous (e.g., API Gateway, ALB) waits for function response and returns result to caller, with client-side retry logic. Asynchronous (e.g., S3, SNS) immediately returns `202 Accepted` and retries on failure with configurable retry policy, DLQ support.

**Q13: How do you configure and use a DLQ for Lambda?**
**A13:** For async invocations, configure a DLQ (SQS queue or SNS topic) in function settings. On reaching maximum retries (default 2 retries), the event is sent to the DLQ. You can process failed events later.

**Q14: Describe how Lambda integrates with API Gateway REST and HTTP APIs.**
**A14:** API Gateway routes HTTP requests to Lambda. REST APIs use `AWS_PROXY` integration with request/response mapping templates. HTTP APIs provide native Lambda proxy with simpler configuration, lower cost, and automatic payload format version 2.0 support.

**Q15: How can you process records from a Kinesis Data Stream with Lambda?**
**A15:** Set up an event source mapping: Lambda polls the stream in batches, processes records, and checkpoints progress. You configure batch size, parallelization factor, maximum record age, retry attempts, and bisect on error for granular retries.

---

## 4. Security & Compliance

**Q16: How do you secure sensitive data in Lambda functions?**
**A16:** Use environment variables encrypted with KMS, AWS Secrets Manager, or Parameter Store for secrets. Avoid hardcoding credentials. Limit IAM permissions to minimum. Enable VPC to isolate functions.

**Q17: Describe how Lambda functions can access resources in a VPC.**
**A17:** Configure subnets and security groups in function network settings. Lambda ENIs are created in specified subnets to access resources like RDS or private APIs. ENI creation adds cold start overhead.

**Q18: What is the AWS Lambda execution context reuse vulnerability?**
**A18:** The execution context may persist data between invocations in warm environments. Sensitive data stored in memory may leak if not cleared. Always initialize locals per invocation and avoid global mutable state.

**Q19: How can you audit and monitor Lambda API activity?**
**A19:** Enable CloudTrail data events for Lambda to log `InvokeFunction` API calls. Use AWS Config rules, AWS CloudWatch Logs, and Lambda Insights for performance and security insights.

**Q20: Explain resource-based policies for Lambda functions.**
**A20:** Resource-based policies define who can invoke the function (e.g., API Gateway, other AWS accounts). They’re applied at the function level, allow cross-account invocations, and complement execution role permissions.

---

## 5. Monitoring & Troubleshooting

**Q21: What metrics does CloudWatch provide for Lambda?**
**A21:** Key metrics: `Invocations`, `Errors`, `Duration`, `Throttles`, `ConcurrentExecutions`, `ProvisionedConcurrencyInvocations`, `ProvisionedConcurrencySpilloverInvocations`, and `IteratorAge` for streaming sources.

**Q22: How do you implement structured logging in Lambda?**
**A22:** Use JSON log entries via standard logging libraries (e.g., Python’s `logging` with JSON formatter) to emit key-value pairs. Use correlation IDs and include context attributes. Logs flow to CloudWatch Logs.

**Q23: Describe how Lambda Insights works.**
**A23:** Lambda Insights collects telemetry (CPU, memory, disk, network, extensions) from a CloudWatch Agent embedded as a Lambda layer. It provides dashboards, logs, and alerts for performance troubleshooting.

**Q24: How can you debug Lambda functions locally?**
**A24:** Use AWS SAM Local or `lambda-local` tools to invoke functions locally with event JSON. For compiled languages, use local debuggers attached to the runtime. Use Docker images for replicate environment.

**Q25: Explain how to handle and retry failures when processing SQS events.**
**A25:** Configure event source mapping with `maxReceiveCount` and DLQ on the queue side via SQS redrive policy. Lambda retries failing batches up to the `MaximumRetryAttempts`. For partial failures, use batch item failures (report item-level errors).

---

## 6. Performance Optimization

**Q26: How do you optimize Lambda cold start performance?**
**A26:** Use provisioned concurrency, reduce package size, minimize initialization code, choose a lightweight runtime (Go, Python), and leverage warming strategies (e.g., scheduled pings).

**Q27: Discuss memory and CPU allocation in Lambda.**
**A27:** Memory setting (128MB–10,240MB) proportionally allocates CPU, network, and other resources. Higher memory improves CPU speed and reduces execution time, but increases GB‑s cost. Optimize by benchmarking various settings.

**Q28: What is provisioned concurrency and how does it differ from reserved concurrency?**
**A28:** Provisioned concurrency pre-initializes specified number of environments to eliminate cold starts, billed per hour. Reserved concurrency caps the max concurrent executions, ensuring capacity isn’t consumed by other functions and preventing throttling.

**Q29: How do you handle high-throughput event sources (e.g., Kinesis) to avoid throttling?**
**A29:** Increase parallelization factor, adjust batch size, use higher memory for faster processing, shard mapping to different functions, or use stream consumer applications (e.g., enhanced fan-out) to distribute load.

**Q30: When would you choose to use a container image over a ZIP file for Lambda?**
**A30:** For large dependencies (>50MB), custom binaries, or specific OS-level libraries. Container images support up to 10GB, custom Docker layers, and consistency with development environments.

---

## 7. Advanced Patterns

**Q31: Explain the fan-out and fan-in patterns using Lambda.**
**A31:** Fan-out: A single event triggers multiple parallel Lambda functions (e.g., SNS topic subscription or parallel Step Functions map state). Fan-in: Aggregating results via a coordinating function or Step Functions, combining responses (e.g., scatter-gather pattern).

**Q32: Describe how to build an event-driven microservices architecture with Lambda.**
**A32:** Use EventBridge or SNS to decouple services. Each service publishes events to a central bus. Lambda functions subscribe to relevant events, perform operations, and emit new events. Enables autonomous scaling and loose coupling.

**Q33: How do you implement long-running workflows with Lambda?**
**A33:** Use Step Functions state machines to orchestrate multiple Lambda invocations with retries, error handling, parallelism, and wait states. Step Functions Standard for long-running, Express for high-volume short-duration.

**Q34: What are Lambda Destinations?**
**A34:** Destinations configure asynchronous invocation success or failure targets (SNS, SQS, Lambda, EventBridge) instead of DLQs and manual monitoring. They automatically route execution records post-invocation.

**Q35: Explain Lambda\@Edge and its use cases.**
**A35:** Lambda\@Edge runs functions at CloudFront edge locations. Use cases: HTTP header manipulation, authentication, dynamic responses, A/B testing, device-based content customization, and request redirection with minimal latency.

---

## 8. Cost Management

**Q36: How can you control and estimate costs for a Lambda-heavy architecture?**
**A36:** Model expected requests and durations. Use Cost Explorer with tags to allocate function-level costs. Set budgets and alarms. Optimize memory settings for cost-performance balance, use reserved/provisioned concurrency only as needed.

**Q37: Compare cost trade-offs between Lambda and EC2 for compute workloads.**
**A37:** Lambda is cost-effective for spiky, intermittent workloads and short tasks (<15min). EC2 or ECS may be cheaper for steady, long-lived processes. Evaluate by TCO: runtime hours, utilization, management overhead.

**Q38: What is the maximum execution duration for a Lambda function and how does it impact cost?**
**A38:** Maximum duration is 15 minutes (900 seconds). Longer executions increase GB‑s usage, raising cost. Split long jobs into smaller functions or use Step Functions for orchestration.

**Q39: How do you avoid unnecessary Lambda invocations?**
**A39:** Filter events at source (e.g., S3 event notification filtering), use event filtering in EventBridge, conditional logic in API Gateway, debounce or batch triggers, and event router functions.

**Q40: Explain how to use CloudWatch Contributor Insights with Lambda logs.**
**A40:** Contributor Insights analyzes logs to identify high-volume contributors (errors, latency). Define rules to extract patterns from CloudWatch Logs, visualize top contributors, and create alarms.

---

## 9. Resilience & Reliability

**Q41: How do you handle retries and idempotency in Lambda?**
**A41:** Design functions to be idempotent (e.g., conditional writes, deduplication using idempotency keys). Configure async retry and DLQs. Use DynamoDB for tracking processed events.

**Q42: Describe cross-region replication strategies for Lambda functions.**
**A42:** Replicate code via CI/CD pipelines (CodePipeline, third-party) to target regions. Sync environment variables and IAM roles. Use Route 53 latency-based routing or failover policies to direct traffic.

**Q43: What are best practices for versioning and deployment strategies?**
**A43:** Use semantic versioning, immutable code versions, aliases for environments, weighted aliases for canary/linear deployments, automated rollbacks on errors, and blue/green patterns.

**Q44: Explain how to secure Lambda functions in a multi-account AWS environment.**
**A44:** Use cross-account IAM roles with strict `sts:AssumeRole` policies, resource-based policies, AWS Organizations SCPs, and centralized logging with a log aggregation account.

**Q45: How can you enforce runtime protections like timeouts and memory limits?**
**A45:** Set function `timeout` conservatively (e.g., a bit above expected max), monitor for timeouts in logs, and set memory limits based on profiling. Use CloudWatch alarms on `Duration` approaching timeout.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting & Debugging

**Q46: What steps would you take to troubleshoot a Lambda timeout error?**
**A46:** Check CloudWatch Logs for timeout stack trace. Profile duration metric. Increase memory/timeout settings. Inspect initialization code. Break down work into smaller functions.

**Q47: How do you troubleshoot permissions errors in Lambda?**
**A47:** Review execution role policy for missing permissions, inspect CloudWatch Logs for `AccessDenied` messages, use AWS IAM Policy Simulator, check resource-based policies if cross-account.

**Q48: What is Lambda event source mapping throttling and how do you address it?**
**A48:** Throttling occurs when concurrent executions exceed reserved concurrency or service quotas. Monitor `Throttles` metric, increase reserved concurrency, optimize processing speed, or shard streams.

**Q49: How to debug memory leaks in a Lambda function?**
**A49:** Use memory profiling libraries during local tests, monitor `MaxMemoryUsed` metric, enable Lambda Insights for memory usage trends, and inspect heap dumps for unused references.

**Q50: Explain how you can trace end-to-end requests involving Lambda.**
**A50:** Enable AWS X-Ray in function configuration. Instrument code with X-Ray SDK, propagate tracing headers through API Gateway or EventBridge, visualize service map in X-Ray console.

---

## 11. Real-World Scenarios

**Q51: Design a serverless image thumbnail generator.**
**A51:** Trigger: S3 `ObjectCreated` event. Lambda reads image from S3, uses Sharp library to resize, writes thumbnail back to S3 (separate bucket/prefix). Use concurrency limits to control burst, DLQ for failures.

**Q52: Build a cost-effective log processing pipeline.**
**A52:** Ingest: CloudWatch Logs subscription to Kinesis Data Firehose. Firehose delivers to Lambda for parsing & formatting, then writes to S3/Elasticsearch. Use batching and compression to reduce cost.

**Q53: Implement real-time chat message processing with Lambda.**
**A53:** API Gateway WebSocket integration → Lambda receives messages → writes to DynamoDB streams → fan-out to consumer Lambdas sending via WebSocket connection IDs. Store connection IDs in DynamoDB.

**Q54: Migrate a monolithic application to Lambda functions. Outline steps.**
**A54:** Identify modules & dependencies. Define event-driven boundaries. Create APIs or events for communication. Package and deploy individual Lambdas. Establish CI/CD, monitor and refine.

**Q55: How would you ensure exactly-once processing in a Lambda-SQS integration?**
**A55:** Use deduplication with FIFO queues (`MessageDeduplicationId`), idempotent function code, DynamoDB to track processed message IDs, and configure `VisibilityTimeout` > Lambda timeout.

---

## 12. Best Practices & Architecture

**Q56: List at least five Lambda security best practices.**
**A56:**

1. **Least Privilege Execution Role**: Grant minimal necessary IAM permissions.
2. **Encrypt Environment Variables**: Use KMS or Secrets Manager.
3. **VPC Isolation**: Place functions in private subnets when accessing sensitive resources.
4. **Enable X-Ray**: For tracing and monitoring.
5. **Use Layers for Dependencies**: Keep package small and updated with security patches.

**Q57: How to structure serverless application projects?**
**A57:** Use mono-repo with separate directories per function, shared libraries in layers, IaC templates, testing framework, CI/CD pipeline, and clear naming conventions.

**Q58: Describe the Twelve-Factor App methodology in the context of Lambda.**
**A58:** Key factors: codebase (single repo, many functions), dependencies (explicit in layers), config (env vars), backing services (external), build-release-run (SAM/CDK pipelines), logging, and portability.

**Q59: Explain how to implement CI/CD for Lambda using AWS CodePipeline.**
**A59:** Source stage (CodeCommit/GitHub), Build stage (CodeBuild to package & run tests), Deploy stage (SAM/CloudFormation to update Lambda), Approval stage, Rollback on failure.

**Q60: What architectural patterns leverage Lambda within AWS Well-Architected Framework?**
**A60:** Serverless web applications, data lakes ingestion, real-time stream processing, event-driven microservices, automation workflows, scheduled tasks. Emphasize operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization.

---

## 13. Integration with Other AWS Services

**Q61: How to connect Lambda to DynamoDB and handle concurrency?**
**A61:** Use AWS SDK within function. For writes, use conditional expressions to avoid race conditions, enable DynamoDB Streams for change capture, handle `ConditionalCheckFailedException` for optimistic locking.

**Q62: Describe processing SNS fan-out with Lambda.**
**A62:** SNS topic publishes messages to subscribed Lambdas in parallel. Monitor subscription concurrency, handle retries and DLQ, use message filtering policies to route specific messages.

**Q63: How does Lambda work with AWS Step Functions Express vs Standard workflows?**
**A63:** Express: high-volume, short-duration (<5min) workflows, low-cost per-execution, best for streaming & IoT. Standard: long-running (>1 year), supports human approvals & audit trail, higher per-state cost.

**Q64: Explain using Lambda with AWS Batch.**
**A64:** Lambda triggers Batch jobs via AWS SDK or EventBridge. Use Batch for large-scale parallel or GPU workloads. Lambda monitors job status and handles results asynchronously.

**Q65: How can Lambda invoke another Lambda function efficiently?**
**A65:** Synchronous: `invoke` API call, wait for result. Asynchronous: set `InvocationType` to `Event` for fire-and-forget, with retries and DLQ. Use Resource-based policies to allow invocation.

---

## 14. Scalability & Concurrency

**Q66: What is the default concurrency limit for Lambda and how do you increase it?**
**A66:** Default regional concurrency is 1,000. Request limit increase via AWS Support. You can also use reserved concurrency per function.

**Q67: Explain how Lambda scales with event source mappings.**
**A67:** For streaming sources, Lambda scales by polling more shards in parallel (parallelization factor). For SQS, Lambda scales by increasing polling frequency and concurrency up to reserved or regional limits.

**Q68: How to prevent noisy-neighbor effects across functions?**
**A68:** Use reserved concurrency to isolate critical functions, separate high-throughput functions into separate accounts or regions, and use throttling and backoff strategies.

**Q69: Describe the concept of function bursting and how to mitigate it.**
**A69:** Sudden traffic spikes cause overscaling and resource contention. Mitigate via provisioned concurrency for predictable bursts, use rate-limiting at API Gateway, or gradual traffic ramp-up via canary releases.

**Q70: How to measure and manage Lambda concurrency usage?**
**A70:** Monitor `ConcurrentExecutions` metric in CloudWatch, set CloudWatch alarms, track per-function concurrency, use `GetAccountSettings` API, and apply reserved concurrency.

---

## 15. Cost Control & Optimization

**Q71: How can you optimize Lambda costs when using container images?**
**A71:** Use minimal base images (e.g., Alpine), multistage Docker builds to strip unnecessary artifacts, and avoid bloated libraries. Leverage ECR image layer caching to reduce deployment time. Monitor image sizes and use Lambda image layers for shared libraries to avoid duplication.

**Q72: Explain how Lambda Extensions can impact cost and how to manage them.**
**A72:** Lambda Extensions run as separate processes alongside functions, consuming memory and CPU, thus increasing GB‑s costs. To manage costs, enable only necessary extensions, configure minimal logging level, and monitor their resource usage via Lambda Insights.

**Q73: What strategies reduce cost when processing large batches of data?**
**A73:** Increase batch sizes to amortize invocation overhead, use streaming services (Kinesis Data Analytics) to filter early, and aggregate records in the function. Use express Step Functions for high‑volume orchestration to reduce Lambda invocations.

**Q74: How does using DynamoDB On‑Demand vs Provisioned capacity affect Lambda cost?**
**A74:** On‑Demand billing charges per request, ideal for unpredictable workloads but can be expensive at scale. Provisioned capacity with autoscaling can lower costs for steady high-throughput. Align Lambda event rates to DynamoDB capacity planning.

**Q75: Describe how to implement client‑side filtering to avoid unnecessary Lambda invocations.**
**A75:** Use S3 object key filtering rules on event notifications, EventBridge event patterns to match only relevant attributes, and API Gateway request validation schemas to reject invalid requests before invoking Lambda.

**Q76: How can step function retries reduce Lambda invocation costs?**
**A76:** By handling transient errors at the state machine level with retry/backoff logic, you avoid repeated Lambda invocation from external triggers. Configure Step Functions retries for idempotent tasks to encapsulate logic cheaply in the state machine.

**Q77: When would saving intermediate results in S3/DynamoDB be more cost‑effective than long‑running Lambda executions?**
**A77:** For jobs nearing the 15‑minute timeout or requiring large memory profiles, break tasks into smaller functions and persist state externally. This avoids high GB‑s consumption and lets subsequent functions resume processing incrementally.

**Q78: Explain how to use CloudWatch metric math to identify costly Lambda functions.**
**A78:** Create CloudWatch dashboards using metric math expressions (e.g., `GBSecond = Average Duration (ms)/1000 * Memory Size (MB)/1024`) to compute GB-s per function. Sort functions by GB-s to prioritize optimization.

**Q79: What role do Provisioned Concurrency auto scaling policies play in cost management?**
**A79:** Auto scaling policies scale provisioned concurrency based on utilization metrics (e.g., ConcurrentExecutions). This ensures you pay for provisioned capacity only when needed, avoiding over-provisioning during low-traffic periods.

**Q80: How does reserved concurrency help control Lambda execution costs?**
**A80:** Reserved concurrency caps a function’s maximum concurrent executions, preventing cost spikes from runaway traffic. It also guarantees capacity for critical functions, enabling predictable budgeting.

---

## 16. On‑Premises & Hybrid Integrations

**Q81: How can Lambda connect to on‑premises systems?**
**A81:** Use AWS VPN or Direct Connect to extend your VPC on‑premises. Configure Lambda in those VPC subnets with proper routing and security groups. Alternatively, use API Gateway private integrations to proxy calls to on‑prem APIs.

**Q82: Describe using AWS IoT Greengrass with Lambda for edge processing.**
**A82:** Deploy Lambda functions to IoT Greengrass Core devices for local execution. Greengrass synchronizes code and manages lifecycle. Functions process sensor data, respond to local events, and only send aggregated results to the cloud to reduce bandwidth costs.

**Q83: What are the challenges of using VPC‑enabled Lambdas for hybrid networking?**
**A83:** ENI cold start overhead, IP address exhaustion in subnets, complex network ACLs, and cross-account routing. Mitigate by using smaller subnets, warm pools, and optimizing NAT Gateway usage.

**Q84: How do you securely authenticate on‑premises services when called from Lambda?**
**A84:** Use mutual TLS with client certificates stored in Secrets Manager, or deploy AWS Private CA for issuing certificates. Rotate credentials automatically and isolate access via dedicated IAM roles and security groups.

**Q85: Explain building a hybrid data pipeline with Lambda and AWS DataSync.**
**A85:** Use DataSync agents on‑premises to transfer files to S3. Trigger Lambda on S3 arrival for processing. Schedule DataSync via EventBridge, and monitor transfer metrics to handle errors and retries.

---

## 17. Polyglot Functions & Runtimes

**Q86: How do custom runtimes enable polyglot functions?**
**A86:** Custom runtimes allow any language by providing a `bootstrap` executable implementing the Lambda Runtime API. Package the language runtime and dependencies in a layer or image. This enables Go, Rust, Erlang, or other languages.

**Q87: Compare startup times for different runtimes and their impact on use cases.**
**A87:** Node.js and Python have fast initialization, suited for low‑latency APIs. Java and .NET have longer cold starts due to JVM/CLR warm-up. Go and Rust compile to static binaries with moderate startup. Choose based on latency requirements.

**Q88: How would you debug a custom runtime Lambda locally?**
**A88:** Use Docker emulation of the Lambda execution environment, mount your code and layer, invoke via Lambda Runtime Interface Emulator (RIE). Attach language-specific debuggers (e.g., Delve for Go).

**Q89: What considerations apply when mixing synchronous and asynchronous patterns in polyglot architectures?**
**A89:** Ensure consistent data serialization across languages (JSON schema), handle retries uniformly, propagate tracing headers for X-Ray, and unify error-handling strategies to avoid silent failures.

**Q90: Explain packaging native dependencies for custom runtimes.**
**A90:** Compile binaries for Amazon Linux 2 (x86\_64 or ARM64) in Docker. Bundle shared libraries in the layer or image. Use multicore build pipelines and test via local container emulation before deployment.

---

## 18. Advanced Debugging & Postmortems

**Q91: How do you perform a postmortem after a large Lambda incident?**
**A91:** Collect CloudWatch Logs, X-Ray traces, and Insights dashboards. Identify error spikes, correlate with deployments. Analyze root causes (e.g., misconfigured environment, code regression). Document timeline, impact, and remediation steps. Share lessons learned.

**Q92: Describe using Firelens for logging and how it aids debugging.**
**A92:** Firelens routes logs to custom destinations (Kinesis, Elasticsearch) via Fluentd/FluentBit. It enriches logs with metadata (function name, version) and allows real‑time analytics and alerting outside CloudWatch.

**Q93: How to debug intermittent Lambda failures in production?**
**A93:** Enable debug-level logging conditionally via environment flags. Use X-Ray to capture full traces. Replay failed events locally with SAM. Implement alerting on error rate anomalies for faster detection.

**Q94: What tools can you integrate for advanced profiling of Lambda performance?**
**A94:** Use AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry with Lambda Extensions, Datadog APM extension, or third‑party profilers like Epsagon. Capture CPU/memory hotspots and cold start metrics for optimization.

**Q95: Explain how to use Lambda function URLs vs. API Gateway in debugging scenarios.**
**A95:** Function URLs provide direct HTTPS endpoints with built-in auth (IAM or CORS), simplifying setup for quick testing. API Gateway offers richer routing, mapping templates, and stages, better suited for complex APIs.

---

## 19. CI/CD & Automation

**Q96: How would you implement blue/green deployments for Lambda functions?**
**A96:** Use aliases and weighted traffic shifting. Deploy new version, assign alias `prod` 100% to current version, then shift 5–10% to new version. Monitor metrics; if stable, ramp to 100%. Roll back by reverting alias weight.

**Q97: Describe automating Lambda testing in your CI pipeline.**
**A97:** Include unit tests with mocks for AWS SDK (e.g., moto for Python), integration tests with SAM Local, and contract tests for event payloads. Fail the build on coverage thresholds and linting.

**Q98: How can GitOps be applied to Lambda function deployments?**
**A98:** Store IaC templates in Git. Use tools like Argo CD or Flux to watch the repo, detect changes, and sync to AWS accounts. Combine with cross-account roles for deployments in multiple environments.

**Q99: Explain how Terraform manages Lambda functions and associated resources.**
**A99:** Terraform’s `aws_lambda_function` resource defines code, runtime, handler, and configuration. Use `aws_lambda_alias`, `aws_cloudwatch_event_rule`, and `aws_iam_role` resources for orchestration. Leverage remote state to share outputs.

**Q100: What emerging features of Lambda should you monitor for future improvements?**
**A100:** Keep an eye on: ARM64 Graviton2 support for cost and performance gains; enhanced EFS performance mounts; Extensions v2 API for richer observability; support for new languages/runtimes; granular billing insights; and deeper X-Ray integration.
