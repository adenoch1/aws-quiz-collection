Basic Concepts
What is Amazon S3?
Answer: Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Objects (files) are stored in buckets and addressed via unique keys (paths). S3 provides 11 9’s of durability by redundantly storing data across multiple Availability Zones.

Describe the S3 data model.
Answer: S3 uses a flat namespace with buckets at the top level. Each object has a key (its unique identifier), data (the file contents), and metadata. Buckets live in a region, have globally unique names, and contain objects of any size up to 5 TB.

What consistency model does S3 provide?
Answer: S3 offers read-after-write consistency for new objects and eventual consistency for overwrite PUTs and DELETEs. This means newly created objects are immediately readable, but updates/deletes may take time to propagate.

How are buckets and objects uniquely identified?
Answer: Buckets require globally unique names (DNS-compliant). Objects are uniquely identified by the combination of bucket name + object key. You can also use version IDs when versioning is enabled.

What limits exist in S3?
Answer: By default, you can create up to 100 buckets per account (soft quota). Unlimited objects per bucket. Maximum object size is 5 TB (multipart upload required for >5 GB). Maximum key length is 1,024 bytes.

Explain how S3 pricing works.
Answer: Charges include data storage ($/GB-month), data transfer out ($/GB), requests (GET, PUT, etc.), and optional features (Lifecycle transitions, replication, etc.). Prices vary by region and storage class.

What are S3 storage classes?
Answer:

Standard: General-purpose, frequent access.

Intelligent-Tiering: Auto-move objects between frequent/infrequent.

Standard-IA (Infrequent Access): Lower cost for infrequently accessed.

One Zone-IA: IA but stored in single AZ.

Glacier Instant/Retrieval, Glacier Flexible Retrieval, Glacier Deep Archive: For archival with varying retrieval times and costs.

When should you use S3 vs. EBS vs. EFS?
Answer:

S3: Object storage for unstructured data, web hosting, backups, archives.

EBS: Block storage mounted to EC2, for OS disks, databases requiring low latency.

EFS: Managed NFS file system for Linux, use when you need shared file access across multiple EC2s.

How do you upload large objects to S3?
Answer: Use multipart upload to split large files into parts (5 MB–5 GB each), upload in parallel, and complete the upload. It improves throughput and resilience.

What is S3 Transfer Acceleration?
Answer: Accelerates transfers over long distances by routing through Amazon CloudFront’s edge network, optimizing path to the S3 bucket.

Can you host a static website on S3?
Answer: Yes. Enable static website hosting on the bucket, configure index and error documents, and optionally use a custom domain via Route 53 and CloudFront.

What is the S3 object URL format?
Answer: https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<key>. Alternatively, path-style: https://s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<bucket-name>/<key>.

How do you version objects in S3?
Answer: Enable versioning on a bucket. Each PUT creates a new version with a version ID. You can retrieve, delete (which adds a delete marker), or restore previous versions.

Explain S3 event notifications.
Answer: You can configure notifications to SNS, SQS, or Lambda for events (e.g., PUT, DELETE). Use this for workflows like thumbnail generation or indexing.

What metadata can you attach to S3 objects?
Answer:

System metadata (managed by S3): Content-Length, Last-Modified, ETag.

User-defined metadata: Custom key–value pairs (x-amz-meta-*). Useful for application-specific data.

What is ETag, and does it always represent MD5?
Answer: ETag is an identifier for the object’s data; typically the MD5 hash for non-multipart objects. For multipart uploads, it’s not a simple MD5 of the whole file.

How do you protect against accidental deletes?
Answer: Enable versioning plus MFA Delete, or use S3 Object Lock (immutability) in Governance/Compliance mode to prevent deletion.

What is S3 Object Lock?
Answer: Allows write-once-read-many (WORM) protection with retention periods. Two modes: Governance (some users can override) and Compliance (no one can override).

Describe S3 Transfer Manager.
Answer: An SDK utility (e.g., AWS SDK for Java) that handles multipart parallel uploads/downloads transparently for large objects.

What is a bucket policy?
Answer: A JSON document attached to a bucket to grant/deny permissions on the bucket and its objects. Evaluated along with IAM policies and ACLs.

Security & Access Control
Compare bucket policies vs. IAM policies.
Answer:

Bucket policies: Resource-based, attached to buckets, can grant cross-account access.

IAM policies: Identity-based, attached to users/roles/groups, govern what actions identities can perform.

What are ACLs in S3, and when would you use them?
Answer: Access Control Lists are legacy, per-object or per-bucket grants (READ, WRITE, FULL_CONTROL). Generally replaced by policies; used for simple, cross-account access where policy isn’t feasible.

How can you restrict access by IP address?
Answer: Use a bucket policy with a Condition on aws:SourceIp, specifying the allowed CIDR or IP range.

Explain AWS KMS encryption options in S3.
Answer:

SSE-S3: Server-side encryption with S3-managed keys.

SSE-KMS: Server-side encryption with AWS KMS-managed CMKs. Offers audit trail and per-object CMK usage.

SSE-C: Server-side encryption with customer-provided keys.

Client-side encryption: Encrypt before uploading using AWS SDKs.

How do you enforce encryption of objects in a bucket?
Answer: Use a bucket policy requiring s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption in the PutObject request or S3 Bucket Default Encryption settings.

What is CORS in S3?
Answer: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing: configure allowed origins, methods, and headers in bucket’s CORS configuration so browsers can access S3 resources from other domains.

How do you audit access to S3?
Answer: Enable AWS CloudTrail Data Events for S3 to log object-level API calls (GetObject, PutObject, etc.). Stored in CloudTrail logs for analysis.

What’s the difference between SSE-KMS and client-side encryption?
Answer:

SSE-KMS: AWS manages encryption at rest; AWS handles encryption/decryption. Keys in KMS.

Client-side: You encrypt data before sending; AWS stores the ciphertext. You manage keys and encryption process fully.

How can you implement fine-grained permissions on folders (prefixes)?
Answer: Use bucket policies with Condition on s3:prefix or s3:Delimiter, or use IAM policy with resource ARN arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/folder/*.

Explain MFA Delete.
Answer: When versioning is enabled, MFA Delete requires MFA authentication for DeleteObjectVersion and PutBucketVersioning operations, preventing unauthorized version deletion.

How do you secure public access at account level?
Answer: Use S3 Block Public Access at the account or bucket level to block ACLs and public policies that allow public access.

What is the principle of least privilege in S3?
Answer: Grant identities only the permissions necessary for their tasks—e.g., allow s3:GetObject but not s3:DeleteObject if delete isn’t required.

How do you share S3 objects securely with external partners?
Answer:

Pre-signed URLs (time-limited).

Cross-account IAM roles with limited permissions.

CloudFront signed URLs for distribution with tighter control.

What is a pre-signed URL and how does it work?
Answer: A URL that includes temporary credentials (signature, expiry) allowing anyone with the link to perform the specified S3 action (GET, PUT) until expiry.

Can you audit access to a specific object?
Answer: Yes, via CloudTrail Data Events, filter logs for the specific bucket/key to see API calls and requester identity.

How do you prevent hot partition attacks?
Answer: Use randomized or hashed key prefixes to spread objects across partitions, avoiding sequential keys that concentrate traffic.

Explain S3’s default encryption.
Answer: Bucket-level default encryption applies SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS automatically to all new objects, even if the client doesn’t request encryption.

What is Access Analyzer for S3?
Answer: A tool that analyzes bucket-level policies and ACLs to identify resources that are publicly accessible or shared externally.

How do you revoke public access quickly?
Answer: Enable S3 Block Public Access, or update bucket policy to deny Principal:"*" for s3:GetObject.

What is AWS Macie and how does it relate to S3?
Answer: Macie uses machine learning to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data (PII) in S3, alerting on anomalies or policy violations.

Data Management
What is lifecycle management in S3?
Answer: Rules that transition objects between storage classes or expire (delete) them after specified time periods or upon reaching certain object age.

Give an example of a lifecycle rule.
Answer: Transition objects to Standard-IA after 30 days, to Glacier after 90 days, and expire after 365 days.

What is object expiration?
Answer: A lifecycle action automatically deletes (or adds DeleteMarkers for versioned buckets) objects when they reach a defined age.

Describe cross-region replication (CRR).
Answer: Asynchronously copies objects from a source bucket to a destination bucket in a different region for compliance, lower latency, or disaster recovery.

What is same-region replication (SRR)?
Answer: Replicates objects within the same region across buckets, useful for data locality, aggregation, or analytics separation.

Explain how replication handles versioning.
Answer: Both source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled. Each new or overwritten object and metadata change is replicated with version IDs maintained.

Can you replicate delete markers?
Answer: You can choose to replicate delete markers or ignore them; configured in the replication rule.

What is S3 Batch Operations?
Answer: Perform large-scale batch operations on millions or billions of objects: copy, tag, invoke a Lambda function, initiate restores, etc., via job definitions.

How do you add or modify tags on existing objects at scale?
Answer: Use S3 Batch Operations with a tagging operation or AWS CLI/SDK scripting with copy-object to rewrite tags.

What is S3 Inventory?
Answer: Provides a daily or weekly CSV/ORC manifest of object metadata (size, encryption status, tags, etc.) for auditing and compliance.

Explain object lock retention periods.
Answer: You specify a retention period (in days or until a specified date). During retention, objects cannot be overwritten or deleted.

How do you restore archived Glacier objects?
Answer: Use RestoreObject API or console, specifying retrieval tier (Expedited, Standard, Bulk) and retention window. Restored object is temporarily available in S3.

What is S3 Select?
Answer: Allows applications to retrieve only a subset of data from objects (e.g., CSV/JSON) using SQL expressions, reducing data transferred.

How does S3 Select improve performance?
Answer: Filters data server-side; transfers only matching records rather than whole object, saving bandwidth and time.

What is Amazon Athena’s relation to S3?
Answer: Athena queries data directly in S3 using SQL without loading it into a database. Useful for analytics on CSV, JSON, Parquet, ORC.

Explain S3 analytics – storage class analysis.
Answer: Tracks object access patterns to recommend lifecycle transitions to more cost-effective storage classes based on infrequency.

What’s the difference between S3 Select and Glacier Select?
Answer: Glacier Select is similar server-side filtering on Glacier archives. Retrieval may incur restore delay; S3 Select is immediate for S3 objects.

How do you handle incomplete multipart uploads?
Answer: Enable lifecycle rules to abort incomplete multipart uploads after N days to avoid extra storage costs.

What is S3 Object Tagging?
Answer: Attaching key–value tags to objects. Tags can be used in lifecycle rules, replication filters, and for cost allocation.

How do you restore an accidentally deleted versioned object?
Answer: List object versions, identify the previous version ID, then copy it to the same key or remove the delete marker.

Performance & Optimization
How does S3 scale for high request rates?
Answer: S3 automatically scales request throughput. To optimize, use random or hashed key prefixes to distribute load across partitions.

What is a hot key in S3?
Answer: An object prefix receiving disproportionate traffic, creating a performance bottleneck on a partition.

How can you avoid hot keys?
Answer: Introduce randomization (UUIDs, timestamp hashes) into key names or use S3 Intelligent-Tiering’s prefix distribution.

What mechanisms ensure data durability in S3?
Answer: S3 synchronously stores data redundantly across multiple devices in multiple AZs; performs regular data integrity checks and repairs.

Explain request rate metrics in S3.
Answer: CloudWatch metrics: NumberOfObjects, BucketSizeBytes, AllRequests, GetRequests, PutRequests, 4xxErrors, 5xxErrors.

How do you optimize S3 GET performance?
Answer: Use CloudFront for caching, range GETs for large objects, multipart downloads, and pre-signed URLs for authorization.

When to use byte‐range fetches?
Answer: To parallelize downloads of large objects, or to resume interrupted downloads.

What is S3 Transfer Acceleration limit?
Answer: Limited to buckets with acceleration enabled; charges extra per GB accelerated. No formal throughput limit, but subject to region-edge connectivity.

How do you monitor S3 performance?
Answer: Use CloudWatch metrics and S3 Server Access Logs (or Data Events in CloudTrail) to analyze request patterns and latencies.

Describe S3 Server Access Logging.
Answer: Delivers detailed logs of requests (source IP, time, request type, key, status) to a target bucket for auditing and analytics.

What are the trade-offs of using CloudFront with S3?
Answer: Improved latency and offload, but adds cost (data out and requests) and complexity (invalidation, configuration).

How do you cache S3 objects at the edge?
Answer: Configure CloudFront distribution with S3 origin, set cache behaviors (TTL, headers), and invalidate when object changes.

Explain the impact of object size on performance.
Answer: Very small objects incur overhead per request; very large objects benefit from multipart. Aim for moderate object sizes or bundle small files.

What is S3 Multi-Part Parallel Download?
Answer: SDKs support splitting downloads into byte-range GETs and fetching parts concurrently, improving throughput.

How does region choice affect S3 latency?
Answer: Choose region close to your clients or compute resources. Cross-region adds latency and data transfer costs.

When should you use multi-AZ vs. cross-region?
Answer: S3 is multi-AZ by default. CRR is cross-region for disaster recovery or geo-redundancy beyond multi-AZ.

What’s the difference between S3 Requester Pays and normal buckets?
Answer: In Requester Pays, the requester is charged for data download; useful when hosting public datasets.

How does S3 handle transient errors?
Answer: Clients should implement retries with exponential backoff for 5xx errors or throttling (503).

Explain adaptive retry algorithms with S3.
Answer: AWS SDKs often implement adaptive retries that adjust backoff based on observed error rates.

What’s the best practice for high-volume PUTs?
Answer: Use multipart uploads, parallelize PUTs, and randomize prefixes to spread load across partitions.

Advanced Features
What is S3 Batch Replication?
Answer: A Batch Operations feature that applies replication across existing objects, not only new ones, by defining a job with a manifest.

Describe S3 Access Points.
Answer: Simplify data access at scale by creating named network endpoints with distinct policies and VPC restrictions per use case.

How do S3 Access Points integrate with VPC?
Answer: You can restrict an Access Point to a specific VPC, ensuring that data is only accessible from that network.

What is S3 Object Lambda?
Answer: Allows you to process data through a Lambda function on-the-fly as objects are retrieved, e.g., image resizing or data masking.

Give a use case for Object Lambda.
Answer: Dynamic redaction of sensitive fields in JSON before returning to clients, without changing underlying objects.

Explain AWS S3 Wrangler.
Answer: A Python library that simplifies interaction with S3 for data analytics, including Parquet, CSV, and Pandas DataFrames.

What is S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval?
Answer: A Glacier storage class offering milliseconds retrieval for archived objects at a higher cost than Glacier Flexible Retrieval.

How do you encrypt data in transit to S3?
Answer: Use HTTPS (TLS) endpoints or enforce aws:SecureTransport in bucket policies. For VPC, use gateway or interface endpoints with TLS.

What are S3 VPC Endpoints?
Answer: Gateway or Interface endpoints that enable private connectivity between your VPC and S3 without traversing the internet.

Compare Gateway vs. Interface Endpoint for S3.
Answer:

Gateway Endpoint (AWS PrivateLink): Free, used for S3 and DynamoDB only via route tables.

Interface Endpoint: ENI-based, for other services, charged per hour and data.

What is S3 on Outposts?
Answer: S3 API-compatible object storage on AWS Outposts racks on-premises, with data residency requirements met locally.

How does S3 on Outposts differ from standard S3?
Answer: Endpoint points to local Outpost, data remains on-prem, supports similar APIs but limited features based on Outpost capacity.

Explain AWS Storage Lens for S3.
Answer: Provides organization-wide visibility into storage usage, activity trends, with dashboards and recommendations for cost optimization and security.

What is S3 Replication Metrics & Notifications?
Answer: CloudWatch metrics and event notifications for replication status (e.g., Replication:OperationMissedThreshold).

Describe S3 Access Analyzer findings
Answer: Identifies buckets with public or cross-account access paths and highlights the specific policy statements causing exposure.

How can you integrate S3 with AWS Backup?
Answer: AWS Backup now supports S3 buckets, allowing centralized backup policies, lifecycle, and restore workflows across AWS services.

What is strong read-after-write consistency and when was it introduced?
Answer: In December 2020, S3 announced strong consistency for all read-after-write and overwrite operations globally, removing eventual consistency altogether.

How do you implement multi-region active-active architecture with S3?
Answer: Use Cross-Region Replication on both directions between two buckets, Route 53 latency-based DNS, or a global accelerator to route clients.
